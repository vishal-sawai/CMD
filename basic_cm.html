            <h1>What is Capital Market?</h1><br>
            <p>Capital markets are venues where savings and investments are channeled between the suppliers who have
                capital and those who are in need of capital. The entities that have capital include retail and
                institutional investors while those who seek capital are businesses, governments, and people.

                Capital markets are composed of primary and secondary markets. The most common capital markets are the
                stock market and the bond market.

                Capital markets seek to improve transactional efficiencies. These markets bring those who hold capital
                and those seeking capital together and provide a place where entities can exchange securities.</p>

                the primary market, the mobilisation of funds takes place through prospectus, right issue and private
                placement of securities. <br><br>

                the
                sense that
                securities which are previously issued in the primary market are traded here. The trading takes place
                between investors, that follows the original issue in the primary market. It covers both stock exchange
                and over-the-counter market.

            <p> A stock exchange is an important factor in the capital market. It is a secure place where trading is
                done
                in a systematic way. Here, the securities are bought and sold as per well-structured rules and
                regulations. Securities mentioned here includes debenture and share issued by a public company that is
                correctly listed at the stock exchange, debenture and bonds issued by the government bodies, municipal
                and public bodies.

            <h1>What is stock market</h1><br>
            <p>Definition: It is a place where shares of pubic listed companies are traded. The primary market is where
                companies float shares to the general public in an initial public offering (IPO) to raise capital.

                Description: Once new securities have been sold in the primary market, they are traded in the secondary
                market—where one investor buys shares from another investor at the prevailing market price or at
                whatever price both the buyer and seller agree upon. The secondary market or the stock exchanges are
                regulated by the regulatory authority. In India, the secondary and primary markets are governed by the
                Security and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

                A stock exchange facilitates stock brokers to trade company stocks and other securities. A stock may be
                bought or sold only if it is listed on an exchange. Thus, it is the meeting place of the stock buyers
                and sellers. India's premier stock exchanges are the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock
                Exchange.</p>

            than gold with a steady demand.

            As crude oil is not domestically available in abundance, almost 82% of it is imported from OPEC and

            <p>The market for trading debt securities like government bonds, corporate bonds and tax-free bonds is known
                as a bond market. A bond market is generally less volatile than an equity market and is more suitable
                for investors with lower risk tolerance. Investing in bond markets is an efficient way to diversify your
                portfolio. The Indian bond market has grown by leaps and bounds after liberalisation. With many foreign
                investors holding a certain proportion of fixed-income instruments in their portfolios, the Indian bond
                market has witnessed strong inflows of foreign capital in the past few decades. The primary role of a

            <h1>Mutual Fund</h1><br>
            <p>A mutual fund is a type of financial vehicle made up of a pool of money collected from many investors to
                invest in securities like stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and other assets. Mutual funds are
                operated by professional money managers, who allocate the fund's assets and attempt to produce capital
                gains or income for the fund's investors. A mutual fund's portfolio is structured and maintained to
                match the investment objectives stated in its prospectus.

                Mutual funds give small or individual investors access to professionally managed portfolios of equities,
                bonds, and other securities. Each shareholder, therefore, participates proportionally in the gains or
                losses of the fund. Mutual funds invest in a vast number of securities, and performance is usually
                tracked as the change in the total market cap of the fund—derived by the aggregating performance of the
                underlying investments.</p>

        <section id="broker">
            <h1>What is Broker</h1><br>
            <p>A broker is an individual or firm that acts as an intermediary between an investor and a securities
                exchange. Because securities exchanges only accept orders from individuals or firms who are members of
                that exchange, individual traders and investors need the services of exchange members. Brokers provide
                that service and are compensated in various ways, either through commissions, fees or through being paid
                by the exchange itself.﻿</p>

            <h1>What is Currency</h1><br>
            <p>Currency is a medium of exchange for goods and services. In short, it's money, in the form of paper or
                coins, usually issued by a government and generally accepted at its face value as a method of payment.

                Currency is the primary medium of exchange in the modern world, having long ago replaced bartering as a
                means of trading goods and services.

                In the 21st century, a new form of currency has entered the vocabulary, the virtual currency. Virtual
                currencies such as bitcoins have no physical existence or government backing and are traded and stored
                in electronic form.</p>
