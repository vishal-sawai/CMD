            <h1>What is Stock</h1><br>
            <p>Definition: A stock is a general term used to describe the ownership certificates of any company. A
                share, on the other hand, refers to the stock certificate of a particular company. Holding a particular
                company's share makes you a shareholder.

                Description: Stocks are of two types—common and preferred. The difference is while the holder of the
                former has voting rights that can be exercised in corporate decisions, the later doesn't. However,
                preferred shareholders are legally entitled to receive a certain level of dividend payments before any
                dividends can be issued to other shareholders.

                There is also something called 'convertible preferred stock'. This is basically a preferred stock with
                an option of converting into a fixed number of common shares, usually any time after a predetermined
                date.</p>

            <h1>Stock Market</h1><br>
            <p>Definition: It is a place where shares of pubic listed companies are traded. The primary market is where
                companies float shares to the general public in an initial public offering (IPO) to raise capital.
                Description: Once new securities have been sold in the primary market, they are traded in the secondary
                market—where one investor buys shares from another investor at the prevailing market price or at
                whatever price both the buyer and seller agree upon. The secondary market or the stock exchanges are
                regulated by the regulatory authority. In India, the secondary and primary markets are governed by the
                Security and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).</p>

                It is the world’s fastest stock exchange, with a median trade speed of 6 microseconds.
                More than 5,500 companies are publicly listed on the BSE.
                The BSE is the world’s 10th largest stock exchange with an overall market capitalization of $2.29
                Trillion as of April 2018.
                As of Feb 2021, 4,722 companies trading on the BSE were worth over Rs 200 Lakh Crore (Rs 2,00,47,191.31

                <br>
                2. National Stock Exchange (NSE)
                The National Stock Exchange (NSE) is the leading stock exchange of India, located in Mumbai,
                Maharashtra, India. It was started to end the monopoly of the Bombay stock exchange in the Indian
                market.

                NSE was established in 1992 as the first demutualized electronic exchange in the country.
                It was the first exchange in the country to provide a modern, fully automated screen-based electronic
                trading system that offered an easy trading facility to the investors spread across the length and
                breadth of the country.
                NSE has a total market capitalization of more than US$ 2.27 trillion, making it the world’s 11th-largest
                stock exchange as of April 2018.
                NSE’s index, the NIFTY 50, is used extensively by investors in India and around the world as a barometer
                of the Indian capital markets.
                The NSE remained the world’s largest derivatives exchange for the second consecutive year in 2020 in
                terms of the number of contracts traded.

            <p>Definition: Initial public offering is the process by which a private company can go public by sale of
                its stocks to general public. It could be a new, young company or an old company which decides to be
                listed on an exchange and hence goes public.

                Companies can raise equity capital with the help of an IPO by issuing new shares to the public or the
                existing shareholders can sell their shares to the public without raising any fresh capital.

                Description: A company offering its shares to the public is not obliged to repay the capital to public
                investors.

                The company which offers its shares, known as an 'issuer', does so with the help of investment banks.
                After IPO, the company's shares are traded in an open market. Those shares can be further sold by
                investors through secondary market trading.

                Buying on margin is the act of borrowing money to buy securities. The practice includes buying an asset

                    boost the stock's liquidity. </li>
                <li> Although the number of shares outstanding increases by a specific multiple, the total dollar value
                    of the shares remains the same compared to pre-split amounts, because the split does not add any
                    real value. </li>
                <li> The most common split ratios are 2-for-1 or 3-for-1, which means that the stockholder will have two
                    or three shares, respectively, for every share held earlier. </li>
                <li> Reverse stock splits are effectively the opposite transaction, where a company divides, instead of
                    multiplies, the number of shares that stockholders own, raising the market price accordingly.

            <h1>11.Bonus</h1><br>
            <p>Definition: Bonus shares are additional shares given Description: The basic principle behind bonus shares
                is that the total number of shares increases with a constant ratio of number of shares held to the
                number of shares outstanding. For instance, if Investor A holds 200 shares of a company and a company
                declares 4:1 bonus, that is for every one share, he gets 4 shares for free. That is total 800 shares for
                free and his total holding will increase to 1000 shares.

                Companies issue bonus shares to encourage retail participation and increase their equity base. When
                price per share of a company is high, it becomes difficult for new investors to buy shares of that
                particular company. Increase in the number of shares reduces the price per share. But the overall
                capital remains the same even if bonus shares are declared.
                to the current shareholders without any additional cost, based upon the number of shares that a
                shareholder owns. These are company's accumulated earnings which are not given out in the form of
                dividends, but are converted into free shares.

                shares that have been bought or dematerialised (converted from physical to electronic shares), thus
                making share trading easy for the users during online trading.

                In India, depositories such as NSDL and CDSL provide Free Demat account services. Intermediaries,
                depository participants or stockbrokers—like Angel Broking—facilitate these services. Each intermediary
                may have Demat account charges that vary as per volume held in the account, type of subscription, and
                terms and conditions between a depository and a stockbroker.

                wants to trade online needs to open a Demat with a Depository Participant (DP). The purpose of
                dematerialisation is to eliminate the need for the investor to hold physical share certificates and
                facilitating a seamless tracking and monitoring of holdings.</p>

                asset or group of assets—a benchmark. The derivative itself is a contract between two or more parties,
