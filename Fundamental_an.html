            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fundamental analysis (FA) is a method of measuring a security's intrinsic
                value by examining related
                economic and financial factors. Fundamental analysts study anything that can affect the security's
                value, from macroeconomic factors such as the state of the economy and industry conditions to
                microeconomic factors like the effectiveness of the company's management.

                <li>Fundamental analysis is used to find the intrinsic value of the company to evaluate whether the

                <li>A balance sheet is a financial statement that reports a company's assets, liabilities and
                    shareholders equity.</li><br>
                <li> The balance sheet is one of the three (income statement and statement of cash flows being the
                    other
                    two)
                    core financial statements used to evaluate a business.</li><br>
                <li>The balance sheet is a snapshot, representing the state of a company's finances (what it owns
                    and
                    owes)
                    as of the date of publication.</li><br>
                <li> Fundamental analysts use balance sheets, in conjunction with other financial statements, to
                    calculate
                    financial ratios.</li><br>

                    incurred during a specified period.</li><br>
                <li>The P&L statement is one of three financial statements every public company issues quarterly and
                    annually, along with the balance sheet and the cash flow statement.</li><br>
                <li>It is important to compare P&L statements from different accounting periods, as the changes in
                    revenues, operating costs, R&D spending, and net earnings over time are more meaningful than the
                    numbers themselves.</li><br>
                <li>Together with the balance sheet and cash flow statement, the P&L statement provides an in-depth

            <h1>5.P/E ratio</h1><br>
            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is used to evaluate companies and
                determine if they are under or
                overvalued. The ratio is computed by taking the share price of the company and dividing that by its
                earnings per share. The P/E ratio shows whether a share of stock pays well compared to its
                price.

                &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, imagine that the price per share is $30 and the stock pays $2
                earnings per share. The P/E
                ratio of the stock is computed as follows:

                30 / 2 = 15

                The lower the P/E ratio, the higher the earnings compared to the stock price, and the more
                attractive
                the stock. Furthermore, an unusually low P/E ratio could show extra potential for a future price
                rise.

                &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the P/E ratio is too low, below 10 for example, this means that the
                price per share seems low
                compared to the company’s earnings especially if competing firms typically have higher P/E ratios.
                This
                might mean that the stock could be undervalued, so its price can increase significantly. The
                opposite
                holds true for high P/E ratios.</p>

            <h1>6.P/B ratio</h1><br>
            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price-to-book (P/B) ratio is a financial ratio that shows how much the
                stock is worth compared to the
                book value of the company. It is computed by taking the price per share and dividing that by the
                book
                value per share.

                &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, if a company worth $10 million has 500,000 shares
                outstanding, it will have a book value
                per share of:

                $10,000,000 / 500,000 shares = $20 book value per share

                If its stock trades at $80 per share, then the P/B ratio is:

                $80 / $20 = 4 P/B ratio

                &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the P/B ratio is more than 1, this means the market’s consensus is that
                the stock will grow at a
                faster pace than its book value suggests, which is the reason why its price is higher than its book
                value. In some cases, you can see very high P/B ratios of 100 or more. High P/B ratios are often
                seen in
                high growth stocks.</p>

                value of a security, as stated by
                its issuer. For stocks, the face value is the original cost of the stock, as listed on the
                certificate.
                For bonds, it is the amount paid to the holder at maturity, typically in $1,000 denominations. The

            <h1>10.EPS</h1><br>
            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Earnings per share relate to the portion of a company’s profit allocated
                to each of the company’s shares.
                The EPS is an indication of the firm’s profitability. The higher the earnings per share, the
                healthier
                the company, so the better the stock should perform for an investor.

                At the same time, if a stock’s earnings per share are unusually high for its company’s industry,
                this
                could mean one or more of the following things:<br>
            <ul><br>
                <li>Earnings are expected to decrease back to more normal levels.</li><br>

            <h1>11.ROE</h1><br>
            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The return on equity is a measurement that determines how efficient a
                company is when using its
                shareholders’ equity. You calculate the ROE by dividing the shareholders’ equity by the company’s
                net
                income. If a company has generated $5 million this year and its shareholder’s equity is $50 million,
                this means the ROE is:

                $5,000,000 / $50,000,000 = 0.1 or 10%

                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Note that analysts typically display the ROE result as a percentage. The
                higher the ROE, the more
                efficient the company is. If a company generates a less than $5 million income this year (say $2
                million) with the same shareholders’ equity, this means it is less efficient:

                $2,000,000 / $50,000,000 = 0.04 or 4%

                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Here, the company has a lower ROE given the same shareholder’s equity, so
                it is less efficient in using
                its shareholders’ equity to generate income.</p>

            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;DII stands for ‘domestic institutional investors.’ DIIs are a particular
                class of investors that
                undertake to invest in financial assets and securities of the country they are currently residing
                in.
                These investment decisions of DIIs are impacted by both political and economic trends. Similar to
                foreign institutional investors (FIIs), domestic institutional investors (DIIs) can also impact the
                economy’s net investment. 

                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In India, domestic institutional investors have quite a decisive role when
                it comes to the performance
                of the Indian stock market, especially when foreign institutional investors are the county’s net
                sellers. As of March 2020, DIIs invested a cumulative ₹55,595 crores in the Indian equity market.
                This
                was a record investment for the country within a single month.</p>
