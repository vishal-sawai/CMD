            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bonds are units of corporate debt issued by companies and securitized as tradeable assets.</li>
                <li> A bond is referred to as a fixed income instrument since bonds traditionally paid a fixed interest
                    rate (coupon) to debtholders. Variable or floating interest rates are also now quite common.</li>
                <li> Bond prices are inversely correlated with interest rates: when rates go up, bond prices fall and
                    vice-versa.</li>
                <li> Bonds have maturity dates at which point the principal amount must be paid back in full or risk
                    default.</li>

            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The bond market broadly describes a marketplace where investors buy debt securities that are brought
                    to the market by either governmental entities or corporations.</li>
                <li> National governments generally use the proceeds from bonds to finance infrastructural improvements
                    and pay down debts.</li>
                <li> Companies issue bonds to raise the capital needed to maintain operations, grow their product lines,
                    or open new locations. </li>
                <li> Bonds are either issued on the primary market, which rolls out new debt, or on the secondary
                    market, in which investors may purchase existing debt via brokers or other third parties.</li>
                <li> Bonds tend to be less volatile and more conservative than stock investments, but also have lower
                    expected returns.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>A corporate bond is debt issued by a company in order for it to raise capital.</li>
                <li> An investor who buys a corporate bond is effectively lending money to the company in return for a
                    series of interest payments, but these bonds may also actively trade on the secondary market.</li>
                Corporate bonds are typically seen as somewhat riskier than U.S. government bonds, so they usually
                <li> have higher interest rates to compensate for this additional risk.</li>
                <li> The highest quality (and safest, lower yielding) bonds are commonly referred to as "Triple-A"
                    bonds,
                <li> while the least creditworthy are termed "junk".</li>

                    government spending.</li>
                <li> Some government bonds may pay periodic interest payments. Other government bonds do not pay coupons
                    and are sold at a discount instead.</li>
                <li> Government bonds are considered low-risk investments since the government backs them. There are
                <li> various types of bonds that are offered by the U.S. Treasury are considered to be among the safest
                    in the world.</li>
                <li>Because of their relative low risk, government bonds typically pay low interest rates.

                    Municipal bonds ("munis") are debt securities issued by state and local governments.
                <li> These can be thought of as loans that investors make to local governments, and are used to fund
                <li> public works such as parks, libraries, bridges & roads, and other infrastructure.
                <li> Interest paid on municipal bonds is often tax-free, making them an attractive investment option for
                    individuals in high tax brackets.
                <li> General obligation (GO) munis provide cash flows generated from taxes collected on a project, while
                    revenue munis return cash flows generated from the project itself.

            <p>A bond index or bond market index is a method of measuring the value of a section of the bond market. It
                is computed from the prices of selected bonds (typically a weighted average). It is a tool used by
                investors and financial managers to describe the market, and to compare the return on specific
                investments.

                An index is a mathematical construct, so it may not be invested in directly. But many mutual funds and
                exchange-traded funds attempt to "track" an index (see index fund), and those funds that do not may be
                judged against those that do.</p>

                <li> An additional upside of inflation-linked bonds is that their returns do not correlate with those of

            <h1>Advantages of bonds</h1><br>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bonds have a clear advantage over other securities. The volatility of bonds (especially short and
                    medium-term bonds) is less than the volatility of stocks (stocks). Thus, bonds are generally seen as
                    safer investments than stocks. In addition, bonds experience less daily volatility than stocks, and
                    bond interest payments are sometimes higher than the general level of dividend payments.</li>

                <li> Bonds are often liquid. It is often fairly easy for an institution to sell a large number of bonds
                    without affecting the price too much, which can be more difficult for stocks. Indeed, bonds are
                    attractive because of the comparative certainty of paying a fixed interest twice a year and a fixed
                    lump sum on maturity.</li>

                <li> Bondholders also enjoy some measure of legal protection: Under the law of most countries, if a
                    company goes bankrupt, its bondholders often receive some money (the redemption amount), while the
                    company’s shares often end up with no value.</li>

                <li> Bonds come with outsourcing contracts (the contract is a formal debt agreement that sets out the
                    terms for issuing bonds) and covenants (terms of such an agreement). Covenants specify the rights of
                    bondholders and the duties of issuers, such as the procedures that the issuer is obligated to
                    implement or is prohibited from implementing.</li>

            <h1>Disadvantages of bonds</h1><br>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The main drawback of bonds is that when compared to stocks, gold, and real estate, the interest rate
                    they generate is much lower. For this reason, people who want to multiply/double their money with
                    some good investment do not put their money in bonds.</li>

                <li> There is always a risk of bankruptcy of the company that issued the bonds. Given the impact of the
                    recession on many companies in recent years, this is one possibility that cannot be completely ruled
                    out. So, if that happens, the bonds will not yield any interest, in addition to the investor losing
                    the principal amount as well.</li>

                <li> The term of long-term bonds can be anywhere more than a dozen years. If the investor’s funds are
                    linked to some long-term, low-yielding bonds and suddenly the interest rates on the banks or other
                    bonds rise, there is not much that the investor can do about the situation. In such a case, the
                    investor would end up earning much less money as he would have if he had invested in other
                    instruments.</li>

                <li> It can be said that bonds if purchased during middle-age or near retirement, can become a good
                    investment because they generate regular income. However, people, especially young people, who have
                    the ability to take risks and are looking for high-return investments, should definitely look
                    elsewhere.</li>

                    Although bonds are considered safe, there are pitfalls like interest rate risk—one of the primary
                    risks associated with the bond market.</li>
                <li> Reinvestment risk means a bond or future cash flows will need to be reinvested in a security with a
                    lower yield.</li>
                <li> Callable bonds have provisions that allow the bond issuer to purchase the bond back and retire the
                    issue when interest rates fall.</li>
                <li> Default risk occurs when the issuer can't pay the interest or principal in a timely manner or at
                    all.</li>
                <li> Inflation risk occurs when the rate of price increases in the economy deteriorates the returns
                    associated with the bond.</li>

                <li> Par value and face value are most important with bonds, as they represent how much a bond will be
                    worth at the time of the bond's maturity.</li>
                <li> With stocks, par value is a mostly arbitrary number, often issued to avoid any potential legal

                Bond trading is the buying and selling of bonds. An investor can either trade old or new bonds. New
                bonds are issued in primary markets all over the world and you can buy these bonds and receive a certain
                predetermined interest.

                Alternatively, which is the most common, bond trading also includes buying and selling of bonds in
                secondary markets. These markets allow investors to make money on the bonds before their maturity.
                Buying and selling bonds in the secondary market entails selling the bonds for a given price, which is
                determined on the basis of the economic outlook and creditworthiness of the issuer.
